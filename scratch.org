** DONE Peripherals of interest
   SCHEDULED: <2021-01-18 Mon>
# Most descriptions are from the ARM Cortex-M4 Technical Reference Manual
- ITM :: Instumentation Trace Macrocell: application-driven trace source
  that supports =printf=-style debugging to trace operating system and
  application events, and generates diagnostic system information. The
  ITM generates trace information as packets from software traces, time
  stamping and global timestamping sources. [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::682++0.00][ITM is a non-invasive form
  of debugging.]]
- ETM :: real-time trace module providing instuction and data tracing of
  a processor. An ETM is an integral part of an ARM RealView debug solution.
- DWT :: Data Watchpoint and Trace: contains four comparators that can
  be configured as hardware watchpoints, ETM triggers, PC sampler event
  trigger, or a data address sampler event trigger.
- TPIU :: Trace Port Interface Unit: acts as a bridge between the
  on-chip trace data from the Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) and the
  Instumentation Trace Macrocell (ITM), with seperate IDs, to a data
  stream. The TPIU encapsulates IDs where required, and the data stream
  is then captured by a Trace Port Analyzer (TPA).
- RTT :: Real-Time Transfer: J-Link/SEGGER-defined protocol for tracing
  via memory buffer. Supported by ~probe.rs~. Allegedly implemented
  using a simple ring buffer.
- Watch points :: Similar to breakpoints; but instead of ~PC~ match,
  debug state is entered when a memory address of interest (and/or a
  variable) is accessed. Can be set on any memory address in any type of
  memory.

*** [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/dm00119316-stm32f411xce-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf::823++0.00][Instumentation Trace Macrocell]] (ITM)
The ITM emits trace information as packets which can be generated as:
- Software trace :: Software can write directly to the ITM stimulus
  registers to emit packets.
- Hardware trace :: The Data Watchpoint Trigger (DWT) generates these
  packets, and the ITM emits them.
- Time stamping :: Timestampings are emitted relative to packets. The
  ITM contains a 21-bit counter to generate the timestamp. The Cortex-M4
  with FPU clock or the bit clock rate of the /Serial Wire Viewer/ (SWV)
  outputs clocks the counter.

The packets are emitted by the ITM are output to the TPIU. The formatter
of the TPIU adds some extra packets and then output the complete packet
sequence to the debugger host.

**** Stimulus ports
- Write all ones to the Trace Privilege Register and read-back; the
  number of ones tell us how many stimulus ports the device has. Always
  a multiple of 8.
- [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::709++0.00][*Writes to stimulus ports must be properly aligned.*]] Non-aligned
  access is /unpredictable/.
- Data written, ~(port ID, write size, data)~, is combined into a packet
  written to FIFO.
- If FIFO is full, *packet disgarded*, and Overflow packet generated.
- Reading stimulus port register of enabled stim. port indicates buffer
  status. *Watchpoint this register to keep an eye on buffer status over
  ITM*. A proposed impl. detail is to check buffer status before
  stimulating. /How does this help?/
- *DWT uses a different output buffer*.

**** Timestamps
[[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::710++0.00][Provide information on the timing of event generation with respect to
their visibility at a trace output port.]]

***** Local timestamps
      Delta timestamp values: each local timestamp indicates the elapsed
      time since generating the previous local timestamp. Generated from
      the timestamp clock in the ITM peritheral. Clock is reset on each
      generation.

      Implementation definitions:
      - timestamp counter size;
      - [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::710++2.71][whether sync or async clock can be used and/or diveded]];

      When a timestamp counter overflows, timer is reset and Overflow
      packet is generated. Subsequently, a local timestamp packet is
      sent. This packet can be preemped, but will always have the
      appropriate value. Local timestamps are maximum 28b. Leading
      zeroes are truncated.

***** Global timestamps
      Absolute timestamp values based on a system global timestamp
      clock. 48b /or/ 68b large. Global timestamps are send in two
      packets.

**** Synchonization support
     Syncronization packets are regularly generated. These can be used
     as a system heartbeat, if enabled. Used to recover bit-to-byte
     aligngment information in a data stream.

*** [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::719++0.00][Data Watchpoint and Trace unit]] (DWT)
    Provides (implementation defined; *can be determined*):
    - Comparators, that support:
      - watchpoints (on memory address), causes the processor to enter Debug state of take a
        DebugMonitor exception;
      - data tracing;
      - signaling for use with an external resource, e.g. ETM;
      - PC value tracking;
      - Cycle count matching;
    - Additional PC sampling:
      - PC sample trace output as a result of a cycle count event;
      - external PC sampling using a PC sample register;
    - exception trace; and
    - performance profiling counters.


**** DWT comparators
     Includes up to 15 comparators that compares:
     - a data address;
     - an instuction address/mask (a range of addresses can be compared against);
     - a data value; and
     - the cycle count counter (comparator 0 only).

     A DWT Data trace packet contains:
     - address of the instuction that caused data access;
     - Bits[15:0] of data access address; and
     - matched data value.

     Exception trace packets can be generated when an exception handler
     is entered. Can also be generated when excpetion handler is
     returned from.

*** [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::749++0.00][Embedded Trace Macrocell]] (ETM)
    Specified in some other document, according to some ETM architecture
    v3.4.

*** [[pdf:~/sync/uni/exjobb/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::750++0.00][Trace Port Interface Unit]] (TPIU)
    A simple bridge between internal debug peripherals (DWT, ITM) the
    outside world. An ARMv7-M compliant TPIU may provide an asynchronous
    /Serial Wire Output/ (SWO). SWO can be used to sidestep the STLink,
    and remove complexity from the export chain.

** Notes
- "Knurling Defmt" for real-time tracing.
- =wfi= causes problems with ITM, RTT.
- Remove openocd from the chain as a start: TPIU must be configured just
  as in openocd. Lackluster API in probe.rs; fork it and experiment with
  values, etc.

** TODO Merge Gabriel's notes below into this document
   Gabriel will work on some other stuff from now on.

*** Notes regarding ITM investigation/research
- Default clocks:
  - SAME5x: 48Mhz
  - F407: 16Mhz
  - F103: 8Mhz
- On SAME5x boards neither TPIU/ITM openocd commands nor probe-rs API is
  sufficient to enable ITM. *Additional steps*:
  - Enable ~GCLK_CM4_TRACE~ clock
  - Set PC27 into function M (~GCLK -> CORTEX_M/SWO~)
    - Question: Is it possible to setup SWO on PB30 pin and if so - how?
      (~SAM_D5xE5x_Family_Data_Sheet_DS60001507F.pdf~; p. 37)
- All platforms
  - Local timestamping (LTS; ~ITM.TCR.TSENA~ enabled) without asynchronous
    clock from TPIU (~ITM.TCR.SWOENA~ disabled) seems to work fine
    although there're also LTS packets without any event associated with
    it popping up regularly on SWO. These are supposedly overflow
    packets because the counter value they carry is suspiciously similar
    to MAX(21-bit unsigned) and LTS counter is 21 bit. This goes however
    against the specification that says that there should be Overflow
    packet + LTS packet, not just LTS packet (ARMv7-M arch ref
    manual; p. 711)
  - Local timestamping (LTS; ITM.TCR.TSENA enabled) with asynchronous
    clock from TPIU (ITM.TCR.SWOENA enabled) counts very slow and as
    such is pretty useless. I don't understand asynchronous clocking of
    ITM and what is it for so I didn't dig further
  - Global timestamping (GTS; ITM.TCR.GTSFREQ != 0x0) seems to be not
    clocked at all regardless of configuration (0x1,0x2,0x3). I couldn't
    find any additional information on the topic; maybe there's
    additional clock that needs to be setup on a per MCU basis?
  - PC sampling (DWT.CTRL.PCSAMPLENA enabled) does not work on F103;
    seems to work fine on F407. I didn't dig much further because I run
    out of time; sampling rate is configurable through other registers.
    If it's higher than ITM throughput - overflow guaranteed. I was able
    to use `pcsampl` tool to profile an application. Pretty nice.
  - Exception tracing (DWT.CTRL.EXCTRCENA enabled) does not work on
    F103; seems to work fine on F407. I was not able to parse SWO data
    with `excevt` because few malformed packets in datastream cause
    parser failure.
  - WFI does not seem to affect the behaviour of tracing module on F407
- Tools & URLs & Docs & Etc
  - @bcantrill from probe-rs Matrix group seems to be knowledgable about
    the topic of tracing; I wasn't able to talk to him though.
  - @japaric isn't available lately
  - ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual (DDI0403E) contains quite
    elaborate specification of tracing, ITM, DWT, TPIU and packeting
    format
  - https://github.com/japaric/itm-tools
    itm-tools utilizes following itm library
  - https://github.com/rust-embedded/itm
  - Notes:
    - itm-tools *probably* is not forgiving enough for data stream; if
      there's a lot of packet sources enabled like PC sampling +
      exception tracing + instrumentation * timestamping chance of
      malformed packets appearing increases (unless there's an
      implementation error in `itm-decode` or/and something itm/dwt/tpi
      is still somehow misconfigured)

** TODO Publish this document on some public repo, hack.md, or similar.
   Should be easy for others to contribute. (Github?)
   Otherwise, resultant notes are likely to be in the final report.


* Meeting at Grepit, [2021-01-28 Thu];

   We want to ditch openocd in favour of ~probe-ps~. This may require
   some changes to the code base because ITM support is presently marked
   as "alpha". In essence, we need to translate whatever openocd does
   OOTB and the gdb commands (?) to a ~probe-rs~ environment.
   - Later these commands will be ported to probe.rs
   - Make sure to find manual references for all commands.

    probe-rs code has been written, but when we read-back our changes
    the register holds the wrong data. Specifically, bit 16 is cleared

    - There is a magical sequence openocd does that ensures ~DWT_CTRL~

   ~DWT~ seems like a struct that only touches registers that relate to
   a single feature. =enable_exception_trace()= only sets ~EXCTRCENA~;
   =enable_data_trace()= enables and takes an address to monitor; etc.

   ~itm.rs~ that touches ITM-related registers.

   Implements decode for exception traces.

   We can trivially decode ITM packets via the probe-rs decoder.

   - Packets can be sent to any suitable trace sink. It mustn't be the
     TPIU.
   - TPIU forms packets into frames, as per CoreSight architecture spec.
   - TPIU transmits packets in LSB.

   STLink does not read all trace bytes from the target, so we must try
   with the serial pin instead. How do we enable it?

   The pin is denoted ~TRACESWO~ in [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/RM0368.pdf::832++0.00][RM0368.pdf: Page 832]]. It is bound to
   PB3 on the Nucleo.

   - Some "serial wire mode; not in JTAG mode" for async mode (only a
     single wire is used)
   - Set ~TRACE_IOEN~ and ~TRACE_MODE = 0b00~ bits. Pin(s) not assigned
     by default.

   Signal is sent on PB3 with the above configured. Default behavior
   appears to be async pin.

   *What is the baud rate?* It is configured in ~TPIU_ACPR~,
   [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::752++0.23][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page 752]]. SWO output clock =
   async_reference_clock/(swoscalar + 1).

   The async reference clock, HCLK, is 16MHz by default, so to set a
   115200 baud rate (yielding good bitsteam) prescalar must be set to
   =16_000_000 / 115_200 - 1=. Bitstream is then read via =stty -F
   /dev/ttyUSB3 115200; cat /dev/ttyUSB3 | tee itm.bin | xxd -b=.

   On the host, we need to set the following
   #+begin_src
   speed 9600 baud; line = 0;
   min = 100; time = 2;
   -icrnl -imaxbel
   -opost -onlcr
   -isig -icanon -echo
   #+end_src
   which can be done by calling =screen /dev/ttyUSB3 9600=

** TODO Setup some trace examples/demos?
   Right now we have a set of binaries (1) that we can trace, a separate
   "scope" that just flashes the binary and optionally enables tracing,
   and then a seperate utility that reads the SWO (stty/screen/cat).
   Should we combine them all into a program that does it all? Worthwhile?

   Further, the two functions that enable tracing on the target --- the one
   we run on the host, and the one we run on the target --- are
   isomorphic. Can we combine them somehow?

   On an exception trace we get an IRQ number, this should map to NVIC
   offset, which then maps to a HW task symbol.

   - irq2symb
   - tasks may not always map to external interrupts. So we must be able
     to map all exception numbers.
   - The vector table contains the entry point address of each exception
     handler. See [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::525++0.00][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page 525]].
   - ~VTOR~ register tells us where the table is in memory.


   - How is the data that ends up in the vector table stored in the ELF?
   - Does the NVIC contain the info I think it does?
     - All NVIC interrupts have an assoc exception number as part of the
       ARMv7-M exception model. See [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::624++0.00][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page 624]].
   - vector_table_addr = VTOR<31:7>:'0000000' exception number N found
     at offset N*0x4.
   - *How long is the table?* Max 496 external interrupts. Read
     ~SCS.ICTR.INTLINESNUM[3:0]~. See [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::618++0.00][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page

    It lives somewhere in the ELF, that's for sure, but where? It's not
    related to flash algorithms, right?
    - Does ~memory.x~ or ~link.x~ tell us, perhaps?
      - Yes, the linker script ~link.x.in~ from cortex-m-rt tells us
        where symbols are stored. The vector table is stored at the
        start of flash, at ~.vector_table~.

    gimli can help us here. See Mark's [[file:rauk/src/analysis/dwarf.rs::pub fn get_subprograms(dwarf: &Dwarf<EndianSlice<RunTimeEndian>>) -> Result<Vec<Subprogram>> {][rauk]] on how all RTIC task names

*** DONE Find task names and interrupt numbers via rtic-syntax
    CLOSED: [2021-04-20 Tue 15:23]
    Instead of reversing the generated binary, in which we would have to
    scan for some ~crate_name::APP~ debug string, we can generate some
    "report" via RTIC codegen that contains a pairing of
    (PAC::Interrupt::nr(), task name), which is then trivially assoc'd
    with the exception number from SWO.

    We'll have to grok rtic-syntax and how its used in cortex-m-rtic to
    finally generate files (or does it just forward a final input to
    rustc?). Nevertheless, we want to read the source file, parse it
    with rtic-syntax, after which we should be able to extract all the
    data we need.

    Alternatively, if source files cannot be read into the proper
    format/type, perhaps we can generate a file beside binary in
    ~target/~?

    Essentially, we want to do something similar to [[file:cortex-m-rtic/macros/src/tests/single.rs::fn analyze() {][this test]].

    Start further grokking at [[file:cortex-m-rtic/macros/src/lib.rs::let (app, analysis) = match rtic_syntax::parse(args, input, settings) {][the app macro]].

    We can find the binding interrupt/exception to a task via
    [[file:rtic-syntax/src/ast.rs::pub binds: Ident,]]. ~binds: syn::Ident~
    has a ~to_string()~ impl.

    https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic-syntax/issues/46

**** The possible approaches to exfiltrate data from an RTIC app
     What we want is to extract arbitrary information about an RTIC app
     from the app declaration in the source file. There are two possible
     ways of doing this: parsing the source file as a whole, and adding
     file I/O to the =#[app]= macro.

     - Parsing the whole source file :: available to us OOTB is
       =rtic_syntax::parse2= that can parse the RTIC application out of
       a =proc_macro2::TokenStream=. From this, we can trivially get the
       hardware tasks and their binding interrupts/exceptions. However,
       the function will only parse the arguments of the =#[app]=
       attribute macro. So if we want to parse the whole source file, we
       have to first make it a =TokenStream=:
#+begin_src rust
    let src = String::from_utf8_lossy(include_bytes!(
        "/home/tmplt/exjobb/rtic-scope/playground/src/bin/tracing.rs"
    ));

    let _syntax: TokenStream = syn::parse_str::<TokenStream>(&src).expect("Unable to parse file");
#+end_src
       then we have to remove all tokens such that only =mod app { ...
       }= remains. This would either warrant another parser to
       rtic-syntax that takes a full source file and returns the RTIC
       app, but the parser could also be exclusive to the resultant
       rtic-scope.

       With this approach, any edits in the source file may not
       necessarily propagate into the binary. Another approach is
       reading the full source file out of the ELF, then the only
       problem is whether or not the current binary is flashed or not.
       The actual source file can be used as a fall-back if source
       cannot be found in the ELF/DWARF.

     - Adding file I/O to the macro :: is another approach that would
       result in making the macro non-pure, and add functionality that
       only a very small subset of users would ever use. This approach
       would mean that the only way data is extracted is via a file
       (preferably under some ~target/rtic-scope~) or by communication
       via some daemon (which means that the daemon will have to be
       alive during binary genration). This approach seems like just
       being more moving parts.

     The =#[app]= attribute is (probably) a pure macro in the sense that
     is takes input code and return output code. I.e.

**** Figuring out the interrupt type
     The interrupt type is =PAC::Interrupt=. We can probably figure the
     PAC out from the arguments to the =#[app]= attribute and by looking
     around in rtic-syntax on how it is resolved, but it cannot be done
     dynamically because Rust itself lacks reflection.

     - Parse the source code of the PAC, specifically the =impl Nr=
       part. Messy.
     - Function that takes a PAC, builds a small library that we
       dynamically call that returns an assoc of interrupts/exception
       string representations and their integer values
     - build argument to rtic-scope where an =Interrupt= with =trait Nr=
       is given. rtic-scope would then be a wrapper for a larger rtic-adhoc-scope.
     - reverse the binary for string repr of exception handler (see [[file:rtic-scope/scope/src/bin/irq2symb.rs::// let function_name: String = if let Some(frame) = ctx.find_frames(handler as u64)?.next()?
       {][irq2symb]]).

     *We want to dynamically build what must be recompiled using cargo
     as a library into a small adhoc lib that does all type recovery*

     We can use cargo as a config with [[file:cargo/src/cargo/ops/cargo_compile.rs:://! The Cargo "compile" operation.][the compile operation]]. +We
     probably want to use ~cargo::core::Workspace::ephemeral~.+

** DONE syntax: figure out crate from rtic app

   - The crate name is presumed to be =first=;
   - The required crate feature is =last=;
   - The device's interrupts are available via =first::last::Interrupt=.

** TODO Investigate watchpoint functionality for SW task tracing
   We may need watchpoints to trace sw tasks. The task queue should be
   monitored.

   Software tasks can nevertheless be extracted by parsing the RTIC app
   declaration.

   A hardware interrupt must be specified as a dispatcher from which
   software tasks are dispatched. A single dispatcher can handle
   multiple software taks.
   - Does this mean that we get an exception trace when a software tasks
     starts?

   we want to filter out the relative (from when the target started)
   ~TimeStamp~ packets and generate absolute timestamps we can attach to

*** DONE Read up on the ITM packet protocol

    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2021-02-19 Fri 09:23]--[2021-02-19 Fri 10:49] =>  1:26

    The packet protocol is described in [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::779++0.23][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page
    779]].

    Notes:
    - If we want to provide an absolute timestamp (e.g. UNIX time, but
      also in nano-seconds) and save the bytesteam for later then we
      need to inject non-standard bytes into the local sink file.
    - If higher prio trace data uses all trace output bandwidth, ITM
      cannot output timestamp packets.

**** Local timestamps
     Delta timestamp since last local timestamp, to reduce bandwidth.
     Payload length depend on required timestamp value. When local
     timestamp packet is generated, the counter is reset to zero.

     Output synchronously (?) to corresponding ITM/DWT data.

     There are two formats to local timestamps:
     - format 1, two to five bytes (LTS1) :: ~TC[1:0]~ indicates the
       packet's relationship with corresponding ITM/DWT data.
     - format 2, single-byte :: only comprised of the packet header.
       Output when the required local timestamp vale is in the range
       1-6. Sync to ITM/DWT data.

**** Global timestamps
     Absolute timestamp values from a system timestamp clock. Can be
     used to provide correlation with other trace sources in the system.

     *Not necessarily supported by all implementations!*

     - Global timestamp it 48b or 64b; determined by implementation.
     - Two formats (for both sizes):
       - GTS1 :: transmits bits[25:0] of timestamp value, compressed by
         not transmitting higher-order bytes that match last global
         timestamp.
       - GTS2 :: transmits remaining timestamp bits in a 5- or 7-byte
         packet. This packet is always transferred in full.
     - A complete global timstamp value is thus transmitted using both a
       GTS1 and GTS2 packet, GTS1 packet first, then queues GTS2 when
       bandwidth is available. [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::785++8.24][May transmit multiple GTS1 packets before
       GTS2, with Wrap=1.]] GTS2 contains higher-order bit for the most
       recent GTS1.

**** Extension packets
     Provides additional information about the identified source. On
     ARMv7-M ITM and DWT packet protocol uses extension packets only to
     provide additional information for the decoding of Instumentation
     packets.

**** Source packets
     Two categories:
     - Softare source/application; instrumentation :: when software
       writes to an ITM stimulus port. Size of write transcation
       determines size of packet. If halfword is written, payload of
       halfword length is written. [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::788++8.96][If ITM impl. supports more than 32
       stimulus ports, extension packet is sent to indicate port.]]
     - Hardware source/diagnostics :: used for event counter wrapping,
       exception tracing, PC sampling, and data tracing. Extension
       packets possible, but unused for diagnostics on ARMv7-M.

     Global timestamps can be generated by enabling them in
     ~ITM_TCR.GTSFREQ~, and in response to DWT requests(?).

     The GTS for the stm32f401re are 48-bit.

     - [2021-02-23 Tue 13:11] global timestamps are all zero.
     - [2021-02-23 Tue 14:05] the stm32f401re may not support global
       timestamps. A ticket has been submitted to ST that asks.

**** TODO Check we get an overflow packet when LTS wraps
     It seems like we get LTS periodically. Verify this.

**** TODO Check if we can interleave intrumentation packets
     Local timestamps aren't useless without a global timestamps, but we
     cannot get any global timestamps from them alone.

     *Weren't global timestamps optional?* "if an implementation
     supports global timestamping". See [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf::785++0.00][DDI0403E_d_armv7m_arm.pdf: Page

     GTS.

**** TODO Generate a sync packet larger than 48b

     sync packets larger than this or does it just send

**** DONE Check if behavior changes when ensuring that master bus is powered

** TODO Make sure we can interleave ITM payloads
   We may want to write arbitrary payloads to the ITM stimulus ports.
   Make sure we can actually do that while we exception trace.

   Will we hit "invalid" packets here, or was that just a thing with
   japaric's decoders?

** TODO Investigate how one would keep a tab on resource (locks)
   The DWT can take arbitrary addresses (although a limited set) and
   generate a timestamped (?) packet when such an address is
   read/written. *Note:* when resources are locked we don't inject any
   code (really?), the task's BASEPRI is changed, however. How can we
   keep tabs on when a resource is locked/unlocked?
   - Can we find the address where the lock is made, store this as a
     symbol in ELF and when watchpoint it?

** STARTED [#C] GUI tool that displays recoded trace
   Discuss the design more with Per before start. Depends on all other
   features. We don't want to pull any platform dependencies (i.e. we
   want to just =cargo install= it); investigate [[https://crates.io/crates/tuix][tuix]], which draws
   everything on an OpenGL canvas.

   An emacs-interface inspired by magit-history could be implemented
   also, but only I would use it.

   Look at the GUI design of https://percepio.com/tracealyzer/ for
   ideas.

   Yatekii is working on this. I will only be working with the daemon
   and backend components.

** The start: low hanging fruit
On task dispatch, send ITM package that contains task ID, scheduled
time, and global timestamp. Or, as a proof of concept: just send the ITM
package at the head of the task definition.

** Later: RTIC Scope
Host application that receives all ITM packages and ultimately present
them in a human-readable format to the end-user.

** In the end: task specific tracing
=#[task(trace = true)]= is the end-goal.

** In the very end: some useful GUI?

** RTIC Scope example applications
- Reimplment the segway system in an RTIC application. Verify
  that implementation /can/ match the underlying mathematical model. If
  this is done, send the report to Khalid. Also: keep Lukas updated
  about the presentation.
  - Sidestep MATLAB/Octave completely and do all computations
    symbolically in a Lisp?
  - Another great example would be a reimplementation of the line
    following robot done in mechatronical systems.
  - Ask Khalid about appropriate real-time goals.
  - Control theory + Lisp + RTIC kan bli riktigt bra blog-artiklar
    annars. Eller separata pubs? Extrem applicering av org-mode.

* Probe-rs thought
- The ITM/DWT packet protocol decoder is found under ~Struct
  probe_rs::architecture::arm::swo::Decoder~. ~swo~ is a bad name.
- [X] The provided decoder will be replaced.
- The receiver of a trace data stream is called a Trace Port Analyzer
  (TPA). See [[pdf:~/exjobb/docs/arm-cortex-m4-trm.pdf::92++0.00][arm-cortex-m4-trm.pdf: Page 92]]. We may want to adopt this
  term to be more easily found.
